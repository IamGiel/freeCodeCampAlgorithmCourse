# freeCodeCampAlgorithmCourse

## Here I tried to complete the algo course in FreeCodeCamp.Org
Notes:

My solution to 'Largest Number in an Array' has completed its task succesfully.  It was not accepted as a correct asnwer until I declared the var that holds empty array locally.  But it works otherwise.  I see this as a possible glitch that perhaps needs to be addressed.
